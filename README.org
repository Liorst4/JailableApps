#+TITLE: Jailable Apps
Quick and dirty script I wrote to check which apps I can jail using firejail.
* Check the status of your jailable apps
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./jailable-apps.sh
#+END_SRC
* Check which apps are already jailed
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./jailable-apps.sh | grep ' is jailed'
#+END_SRC
* Check which apps can be jailed
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./jailable-apps.sh | grep ' is not jailed'
#+END_SRC
